# re-frame A to Z

Here lies the interactive slides my speech at Moscow Clojure(Script) Meetup 2/25/2017.

This presentation gives a general understanding of what [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) is about, explains it's core concepts, usage experience and some underwater stones (aka daily pain-points).

## Run presentation:

```
lein cooper
```
This command will run `lein less auto` and `lein figwheel dev` in parallel.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Live streaming demo (live emojis)

There is a section of this talk that refers to http://clojure.tv service, which is essentially a
simple emoji proxy with WebSocket-based streaming to attached clients.
You can find it's source code here: https://github.com/vintlucky777/emoji-likes

## Production Build

_wait, what? seriously?! ;)_
