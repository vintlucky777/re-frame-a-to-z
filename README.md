# re-frame A to Z

Here lies the interactive slides my speech at Moscow Clojure(Script) Meetup 2/25/2017.

This presentation gives a general understanding of what [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) is about, explains it's core concepts, usage experience and some underwater stones (aka daily pain-points).

## Run presentation:

```
lein figwheel
```

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

## Production Build

_wait, what? seriously?! ;)_
